‎
‎## 🧱 Components
‎
‎- **Frontend**: React (website/dashboard), Flutter (mobile app)
‎- **Backend**: Node.js with Express or Django REST Framework

‎
‎## 🔄 Data Flow
‎
‎1. Staff logs in via frontend.
‎2. Backend authenticates and returns token.
‎3. Reports and alerts are submitted via API.
‎4. AI engine processes video and tags activity.
‎5. Dashboard displays live alerts and logs.
‎
‎---
‎
‎## 🔐 Security
‎
‎- HTTPS encryption
‎- JWT authentication
‎- Role-based access control
‎- Audit trail for sensitive actions
